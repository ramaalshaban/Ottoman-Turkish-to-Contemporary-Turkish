# Ottoman-Turkish-to-Contemporary-Turkish

For many years, optical character recognition (OCR) has been one of the most researched topics. As a result of these studies, systems developed especially for the Latin alphabet have become more accurate even for handwritten texts. 
However, there are very few studies on Ottoman OCR systems in the literature, and it remains a topic of interest due to the language's complexity in grammar, writing, and spelling. The goal of this project is to create an OCR system that recognizes Ottoman characters with neural networks. The proposed work consists of several steps, including image processing, image digitization, and character segmentation, network training, recognition, and evaluation of results.
